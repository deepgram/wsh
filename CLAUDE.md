See @docs/VISION.md for project vision and purpose.

# Additional Instructions
- Project is under active development. Do not criticize missing features.
- When implementing new features or making material refactors, ensure
  that unit tests are in place.
- When finishing an implementation phase, ensure integration and/or
  end-to-end tests are in place.
- After implementation, ensure that our API documentation, README, and
  skills are fully up-to-date.
- The core skill can talk about the API "how", but the specialized
  skills should only talk about the content -- the "what" -- without
  referring to any specific protocol. This keeps the skills relatively
  independent of protocol (e.g., HTTP, MCP, etc.).
